# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participating in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This is regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

We encourage the following behaviors to cultivate a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Offering and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility for our actions and learning from the experiences.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at faq-mentor@mail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
